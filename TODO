Reorganize & change:
- change existing functions to match the plans below

- (maybe) make an Rmd template - not certain this is necessary
- (maybe) allow user to store SA package location (in synced O365 folder)
  - potentially even prompt the user to store this on install

- write vignette
  - R Prerequisites
    - Basics
    - Rstudio
    - RMarkdown
  - philosophy behind saproj
  - starting a project (files/folders that get created)
  - Reasoning for directory structure
  - example projects
    - a minimal example (load, clean, do)
    - a more complex example (1-prep, 2-profiles, 3-results)
  - making a section
  - working form Rmd vs R scripts
