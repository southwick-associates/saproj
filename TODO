Reorganize & change:
- change existing functions to match the plans below

- (probably) store code in top-level directories
  this allows for less file navigation (particularly backwards in Rmd)
- make an Rmd template
- (maybe) allow user to store SA package location (in synced O365 folder)
  - potentially even prompt the user to store this on install
- write vignette
  - philosophy behind saproj
  - starting a project (files that get created)
  - making a section
  - working form Rmd vs R scripts
